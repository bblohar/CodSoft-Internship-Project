Project Overview
This repository showcases various data science and machine learning tasks, from classical classification problems to regression and handling imbalanced datasets. Each project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook, providing a step-by-step analysis, model building, and evaluation.

üöÄ Projects
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Description: This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as passenger class, sex, age, and fare.

Dataset: Titanic-Dataset.csv

Key Libraries & Techniques:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: For splitting data into training and testing sets.

sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression: For building the classification model.

sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score: For evaluating model performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To run these notebooks, you'll need Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

(Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub details)

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
Install all required Python packages. A requirements.txt file is ideal, but for now, you can install them individually:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib

Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:

jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab

This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface. From there, you can navigate to and open any of the .ipynb files.

üí° Usage
Open any of the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You can run the cells sequentially to see the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

Colab: You can also open these notebooks directly in Google Colab by uploading them or by using the "Open in Colab" badge if you add one (as seen in PT_3.ipynb's markdown cell).
